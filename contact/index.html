description: I believe that yoga is accessible to everyone. The key to this accessibilty is incorporating the principles of alignment in every class while also  providing physical modifications and use of props, so that every student has a place to go in every pose. For years, I would allow teachers to push me past my limit in yoga classes and would usually injure myself in the process. As a teacher, I apsire to make my classes ego-free, so that my students will be comfortable enough to respect their limits while also feeling safe enough to try new things. My classes focus strongly on the breath, and uniting the breath with movement, and my goal is for every student to leave feeling better than they came in.
