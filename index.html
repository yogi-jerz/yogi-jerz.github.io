title: Welcome to Yogi Jerz
description: I believe that yoga is accessible to everyone. The key to this accessibilty is incorporating the principles of alignment in every class while also  providing physical modifications and use of props, so that every student has a place to go in every pose. For years, I would allow teachers to push me past my limit in yoga classes and would usually injure myself in the process. As a teacher, I apsire to make my classes ego-free, so that my students will be comfortable enough to respect their limits while also feeling safe enough to try new things. My classes focus strongly on the breath, and uniting the breath with movement, and my goal is for every student to leave feeling better than they came in.

                    <p>Through a consistent practice of yoga and meditation, Jersey found herself living a fuller and more balanced life - in mind, body, and spirit. Having suffered from an injury 10 years ago that limited her yoga practice, Jersey learned that props, modifications, and honoring one’s limitations are the key to maintaining a healthy and steady practice. As a result, Jersey strives to teach an ego-free class, with a strong focus on alignment, breath, and intention. In addition, Jersey’s classes often take a seasonal approach, as her studies in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda play a large role in her personal practice. A life-long learner, she is constantly striving to find new and interesting ways to bring yoga and it’s philosophies into the lives of her students.</p>

                    <h3 class="ui header">About Me</h3>

                    <p>Jersey first came to yoga as a place to quiet her busy mind and relieve stress. Throughout the years, she has consistently gravitated towards the slower practices of Hatha and Yin, but she has also come to appreciate the sweat and flow of a Vinyasa class. She has found that a daily practice of asana and meditation, combined with a conscious whole foods diet, is the perfect recipe for feeling healthy and happy. Jersey received her 200 RYT through Satyam Yoga School in 2015 and she loves teaching new and seasoned students alike. A lover of all things outdoors, Jersey especially loves skiing in mountains and swimming in lakes. She is currently teaching yoga in Portland, Maine and lives with her husband and pup.</p>
